## Design

### 1. Colour Scheme
* A materalize tropical green - #00e676(green accent-3) has been used as the main background color for the Navbar, Footer, font awesome icons & buttons as asian cuisine has often vibrant greens in the cuisine so ties in with the theme. 
* The buttons have various colours which match the icon colors which help make it clearly identifable which icon category is associated with each button. Food & drink button - rgba(245, 161, 97, 1), Hostel button - rgba(130, 228, 211, 1);, attractions button - rgba(212, 173, 222, 1); These colors have also been selected so the black text is easy to read.
* The google maps api color scheme of atlas has been selected as it ties in nicely with the light blue background color.
* Icons on the map are slightly darker versions of the button colors so they are easily visble on the map.
* Text is either black or light blue - rgba(225, 254, 251, 1) across the webpage depending on background color.

Contrast Checker used to check colors of buttons match with text so its easy to read - [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/?c=000000&b=1155dd)

### 2. Typography
* The font style of Amatic SC has been chosen for the website brand/logo (Explore Siquijor) within the header & footer. This hand drawn web font is designed to give a rustic feel to the website brand.
* The font style of Neucha has been selected for all other content which is a relaxed style selected to represent the relaxed vibe of the island.
* All font has a letter spacing of 0.05em to make it easier to read.
* The fallback fonts across all webpages is sans serif for any reason the main fonts do not import correctly.

### 3. Imagery

* Upon clicking the top tips button an image of someone riding a scooter along a scenic road surrounded by tropical scenery is designed to engage the user to inspire adventure.
* Background image on opaque overlay on form has been selected as it fits in with the color scheme and shows the beauty of the coastline in the Philippines.
